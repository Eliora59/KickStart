# KickStart

This repository contains kickstarts files for Debian (preseed.txt) and RedHat (kickstart.txt) for auto install of virtual machines  

I self-hosted my files on my website :
- http://ks.overcomputing.net/preseed.txt
- http://ks.overcomputing.net/kickstart.txt

This Kickstart is a minimal installation that deletes all partitions. It also creates a "theophile" user with "root" as password. These kickstarts are only for testing on VMs.
